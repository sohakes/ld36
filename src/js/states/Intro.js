        Now they can't stay apart for more than 10 seconds, or else they simply
        disappear in a puff of smoke. Even if they get together, they will be
        separated again and will find themselves in another labyrinthic dungeon.

        Happily for our colored characters, the mage was good enough to give a
        torch to each one of them, and let them free if they happen to get 
        together five times. So, good luck!
